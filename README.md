### Banking Application  

# Banking Application  

A console-based banking system built with **Java**, designed to perform essential banking operations like account management and transactions.  

The Banking Application is a robust desktop-based program developed using Java, offering essential banking functionalities in a secure and user-friendly interface. This application simulates common banking operations like account creation, balance inquiry, deposits, and withdrawals, providing users with a practical tool to manage their finances. By leveraging Java's core programming features, the application ensures reliable data handling and smooth operation.

The application employs object-oriented principles, making it modular and easy to maintain. Each account is represented as an object, with associated properties like account number, holder name, and balance. Users can interact with the system through a console-based interface (or GUI if extended) to perform various operations. Exception handling mechanisms ensure that invalid operations, such as overdrawing an account, are prevented, maintaining the integrity of the data.

Ideal for beginners learning Java, this project introduces concepts like file handling, encapsulation, and inheritance. It also serves as an excellent foundation for understanding how real-world banking systems work. With further enhancements, such as integrating a graphical user interface (GUI) or database connectivity, the Banking Application can be expanded into a more comprehensive system.

## Features  
- Create accounts with unique account numbers and holder details.  
- Perform secure deposits and withdrawals.  
- Check account balances instantly.  
- Prevent invalid operations (e.g., overdrafts).  
- Modular and extendable design using object-oriented programming.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Java**: Core logic and functionality.  

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.  

### Installation  
1. Clone the repository:

### Number Guessing Game  

# Number Guessing Game  

A fun and interactive console-based game built with **Java**, where players guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.  

The Number Guessing Game is an entertaining and engaging application built using Java, designed to test and improve a user’s guessing skills. The game generates a random number within a specified range, and the player must guess the number with as few attempts as possible. After each guess, the program provides hints such as "too high" or "too low," guiding the player closer to the correct answer.

The application’s simplicity makes it an excellent starting point for learning Java. It demonstrates essential programming concepts such as generating random numbers, implementing loops, and handling user input. Additionally, it uses conditional statements to evaluate guesses and provide feedback, making it a great example of decision-making in programming.

For added functionality, the game can include features such as tracking the number of attempts, implementing difficulty levels, or introducing a timer to challenge the player further. With a console-based interface, the Number Guessing Game ensures smooth and responsive gameplay, but it can be expanded into a graphical interface using Swing for an enhanced user experience.

This project is perfect for beginners looking to apply their Java skills to a fun and straightforward problem. It combines logic, creativity, and programming basics, making it both an enjoyable and educational exercise.

## Features  
- Random number generation for dynamic gameplay.  
- Provides feedback ("too high" or "too low") after each guess.  
- Tracks the number of attempts to guess the correct number.  
- Simple, intuitive, and beginner-friendly interface.  

## Technologies Used
